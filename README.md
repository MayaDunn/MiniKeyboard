# MiniKeyboard
A quick script to run an arduino keyboard I built. Each key is wired to one pin and ground. A set of keys controls which of the several layers I am accessing. The multiple layers allow this 12 key board to run through the whole alphabet, some numbers, and basic commands, but it also gives the device an overly steep learning curve.
